Yet, existing work on the prediction of court decision-making has two important limitations. First, it exclusively focuses on the US Supreme Court. This raises concerns about the external validity of previous stud- ies and their implications for courts in different law traditions. Second, none of the existing studies have explicitly tested the relative contribution of legal context versus political context factors to the forecast of court decisions. This study addresses these two points by ex ante predicting over 2,900 decisions of the German Federal Con- stitutional Court. I find that similar methodological approaches successfully applied to predict Supreme Court decisions also work for Kelsenian European constitutional court types. My results also show that the legal context of a decision is already a good predictor. However, the predictive performance is significantly improved when information about the political context of a decision is added. These findings therefore support the view of a multifaceted decision-making of constitutional courts which is best characterized by the ensemble of both legal and political factors.","tags":[],"title":"How to Forecast Constitutional Court Decisions?

However, researchers face a dilemma while data has to be publicly available to make research reproducible, information about individuals needs to be protected. Synthetic copies of original data can address this concern, because ideally they contain all relevant statistical characteristics without disclosing private information. But generating synthetic data that captures--eventually undiscovered--statistical relationships is challenging. Moreover, it so far remains unsolved to fully control the amount of information disclosed during this process. To that end differentially private generative adversarial networks (DP-GANs) have been proposed in the (computer science) literature. We experimentally evaluate the trade-off between data utility and privacy protection in a simulation study by looking at evaluation metrics that are important for social scientists, specifically in terms of regression coefficients, marginal distributions and correlation structures. Our findings suggest that on average, higher levels of provided privacy negatively affects the synthetic data quality. We hope to encourage inter-disciplinary work between computer scientists and social scientists to develop more powerful DP-GANs in the future.","tags":[],"title":"An Empirical Evaluation of DP GANs for Social Science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Engst","Thomas Gschwend","Sebastian Sternberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552348800,"objectID":"9ab219cb66fd50976c1d747052ea3572","permalink":"https://sebastiansternberg.github.io/publication/pvs_discrete_choice/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pvs_discrete_choice/","section":"publication","summary":"Welche Kandidierenden w√ºnscht sich die √ñffentlichkeit als Richterinnen und Richter am Bundesverfassungsgericht?
